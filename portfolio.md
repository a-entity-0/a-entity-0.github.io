I am focusing primary on scientific computing and computer vision.I am part of several online coding groups and developing research projects on self interest and a member of Machine learning & AI Foundation - Bangalore Chapter.Currently i am learning to built and train standard neural network Architectures like resnet,dense net,Vgg etc.. and trying to build own network architecture models .Also reading research papers on computer vision and blogging about papers.Areas such as Image classification ,Sematic segmentation,Object Detection,OCR,GAN's are my favourite areas. I finished my Machine learning certification from Coursera(Andrew Ng's course) one year ago and working on my git projects .Love to have challenges at work and do research work on machine intelligence.
