Machines .I love Machines I have a very great respect for them .From the invention of wheel to calculators (computers) machines had been a very good friend to humans .I think time has come that its our human resposiblity to give intelliegence to machines and guide them in right path.I believe that by giving intelligence to machines human himself or themself could reliase whom they are and humans could leverage their civilization standard to the next level.


I believe that entire nature is god(god type one).Also I  believe in (gods type two) shiva,vishnu,brahma,jesus,buddha,allah...I also believe that (god type three )"each and every person is god when they realize theself " .Also i believe (god type 4) every entity that exists in this world is god .Entity might be an object ,love,,internet,computer(machines),hope with efforts,work that you do everyday anything and everything.You know in the world of python everything is an object .it may be contradictory in present world(einstein's physics view) but in accordance with quantum world/science(Testla,Heisenberg) those statements holds true because its the place of observance/place of perception that matters.One of the foremost beliefs i had was "in order to have a greater perception of the world you need to have a theory(statement/story) to believe in all/everything/everytheory that survived time could exist".You can have transmission of data through time as an evidence.Untill now 2018 time could be the greatest evidence i dont know what will happen when quatum comes, the father of time.Which ever entity in this world goes thorugh a cyclic phase- creation(birth)(brahma),growth(live)(vishnu),destruction(death)(shiva).Entire universe is a transformation of one to another then to another then to one.

### More Information

I use my gmail account as a primary contact and I am at a very important phase of my life deciding the way by which i am going to contribute to the welfare of this world(Earth and near by planets) and civilization(both human and machines) .So I think the welfare of the world and civilisation is much more important than me or my cirlces so i use mobile phone as a secondary contact.The probability that you may reach me through mail is higher than mobile.
