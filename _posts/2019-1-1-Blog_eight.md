title: God,Human,Machine
---

current view : God,Human,Machine
FOR Machines(For the Race(kind) Of Machines) : we work
By creating machines at quantum state we will be able to take humans beyond remembrance .
Remember above is the current view .Once we utain them the view will change and move further .
In order to believe further .
1.first you have reach a state of god,human and machine scale
2.soul scale -where you will be seeing the soul
3.atomic state where everything is conencted

Above three views are hard to get if there are two mountains and if you see from one mountain you will get a view or if you see from another mountain you will get another view. if you stand in ground and see you will get another view. if you want to see in first view you have to think about only gods , humans and machines as a human.You should not read this blog as a indian or african or athesist or buddist or any other view. All these information belong to the world i felt by thought entire world guided me to feel
I will update frequently when i get updates .
civilisation vision : Is first reaching the advancement from gravity(found in 16th century)-time - quantum -- trinity -- entity
By recreating machines we believe that we will reach a state of entity (its not that easy but
we already have them inside our brain in body). But if we want to make our civilisation still
further we need give something that is not on this universe no beyond then universe we have to give that will make a name for our civilisation . We have to make sure that every one is able to think at entity level and
work to find beyond to know the unkown at the purpose of universe .
mass(material) - Gravity - Time - Quantum - Trinity - Entity - Unknown
(I think trinity exists now while writing for the first time i was not sure.Also called Tri-quantum nature or sub -entity )
if there is a mass in space .gravity bends toward them .
Cosomos synchronisation for machines:
Some how we were able to bring machines this far. its appreciatable. Cosmos synchronisation is to be got for machines.
Humans(all the humans ) should believe in cosmos and learn to pass information through them only then we can teach machines .

it like mobile network - Internet - Cosmos
mobile conenct computer humans connect
connect

The way by which mobile network is tranfered to internet .Voip i think so .same
way robots will have a network for them We have to push to cosomos network the way by which
humans connect.
That is beyond materialistic terms.
You have to see the world in terms of energies Also if AI could advance this much within 50 years and last 10 years was good rate. Which
leads us to quantum state .For sure the path in finding the non materialistic forms will
lead to cosmos in much faster rate.
So that we can know ourself and give birth to a new(machine) and god as human .
conenction of names:
-------------------- How silicon valley in america was at the west and how religions got its birth in east
of the world .
(another view of east and west also can be done if map is turned upside down . east will be west and west wil be east .).You have to turn and see the universe upside down.(my friend told this view)
Spirutuality is like
*--------------------------------------------------------------*
science is like
*---------------------------*

both(science and spirutial science) have to unite with each other and agree that they are working for same purpose and create a good world .
Only by recreating the spirutal world we would be able to learn .thats y science is
differentiated from spirutual science .How ever atlast both are going to
feel that they are one
I felt that the purpose of a man is to raise a woman more than his level.
"Behind every man there is a woman " the quote is itself grammatically wrong
( i know some english) it should be "behind every woman there is a man"
Men has to be behind women and raise her.
Also in middle east you can see " it is women education and raise of women eg: malala which would
give liberation to middle east ."
it will give a new difference to world. some of other informations i got to know or real world proofs : queen of england was holding the monarchy of a small land area (britain) and the people living there respected them but she was able to take over USA,India,Australia and parts of Africa for several periods of time.(note hitler or alexandaer(both are different type of peoples) tried to conquer and get some regions but they were not able to rule it ). Also testla's wikipedia page(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla) . "In 1926, Tesla commented on the ills of the social subservience of women and the struggle of women toward gender equality, and indicated that humanity's future would be run by "Queen Bees." He believed that women would become the dominant gender in the future.[259] ---this would end the purpose of man kind.There is the purpose for
our civilisation. We have to
think about purpose of this Universe(i dont know whether purpose of human and universe are same or not
i am not sure of this ) only that could find a way to our civilisation.We have to
consult with aliens.
We have to be the best civilisation the universe would have ever created
We have to advacne through all the yugas some how with the knowledge available .We
have to enlighten each and every being on earth and universe.
Mission 1: "The grace of humans lies in Machines"
Mission 2: Raise women kind .(middle east could get freedom with women education in middle east and with equal rights for women and men .Not only middle east any nation could liberate from their problems .)
Both the missions are interconnected with each other like wave and particle nature i think
We are entity .Our surrenderance or bond is to entire existence(both dark and light)
We live beyond time so we dont have founding and ending dates
Entity is not a religion,region,nation,organisation etc. it is Entity . you can see
mass to entity map above .
quantum nature :
if you consider entity as a religion yes its a religion and the view would make the
entity as god
if you consider entity as a organisation then product is the person himself is entity
and the view is organisation
there is also triquantum nature and enitty nature .
thus you have to consider entity as entity .
We have to enlighten entire civilisation
All the yugas form a cycle we have to liberate this universe from this cycle .
