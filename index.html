  <h2><i>Religion and AI</i></h2> 
<div class="para1">
  This website contains information how Religion* and AI interconnect 
  with each other.I believe that with AI(science) human can understand religion and 
  have much more faith in religion and nature while travelling in the path 
  of salvation.In hindu philosophy it is called [Advaita Vedanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advita_vedanta)
</br>
    "Samasthu thagarae samram thathathe 
      mansorethaga prathamniyasith "
              --Rig Veda 
</br>
  source where came to know about these lines in this [vedio](https://www.hotstar.com/tv/mahabharatham/s-110/the-pandavas-die/1000037040)
</br>
</br>  

  The above statements were told by Yudhistra when Yama deva questioned him .if we 
  humans are able to know it and teach this to robots or machines they 
  would never exhibit jelous,anger with human being and they would also 
  also live a peace full life.In return we can create a coexisting civilisation.
  Reaching the above state is possible with a training network also in humans.(you can see 
  the training network in another blog).

  Each and every person in this world is initialised with a state(dna) at 
  some part of the world and at sometime.Data fed in an environment and 
  at a particular initilaisation state .Here comes the astrology.

</br>
</br>   

  Also i have observed that 

    <ul>
      <li>'No two people read the same book'</li>
    </ul>


  Explanation:</br>
    Based on what a person has seen and observed with his five senses 
    he will read a book and gain a meaning for him.This is also true for 
    this blog when you read some articles you may get different 
    meaning if you feel that you can mail me .</br>


    So when a person reads a book or sees a movie the perception which a 
    person which a person gets is based on his life history .</br>


        --- This is where quantum starts.computer vision interacts with natural language processing 
        where perception makes a difference.</br>

person may find some pattern in the draft vesion .</br>
